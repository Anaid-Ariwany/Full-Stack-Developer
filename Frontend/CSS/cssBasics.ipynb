    "- There are 3 methods to add CSS to HTML:\n",
    "    1. Inline CSS: makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn’t as recommended:\n",

    "        <h1 style=\"color:blue;text-align:center;\">This is a heading</h1>\n",
    "        <p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:20px;\">This is a paragraph.</p>\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    2. Internal/ Embedded CSS: involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <style> tags, which are then placed inside of the opening and closing <head> tags of your HTML file.\n",

    "          </style>\n",
    "        </head>\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. External CSS: involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML’s opening and closing <head> tags with a void <link> element:\n",

    "- Selectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they’re what is actually being “selected” for each rule.\n",
    "- There are different types of selectors in CSS, including:\n",
    "  - **Element/Type Selector**: Selects all elements of a given type. Example: `p { color: blue; }` selects all `<p>` elements.\n",
    "  - **Class Selector**: Selects elements with a specific class attribute. Example: `.my-class { font-size: 16px; }` selects all elements with the class `my-class`.\n",
    "  - **ID Selector**: Selects a single element with a specific ID attribute. Example: `#my-id { margin: 10px; }` selects the element with the ID `my-id`.\n",
    "  - **Universal Selector**: Selects all elements on the page. Example: `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` applies to all elements.\n",
    "  - **The Grouping Selector**: Combines multiple selectors to apply the same styles to different elements. Example: `h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Arial; }` applies to all `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` elements.\n",
    "  - **Chaining Selectors**: Combines multiple selectors to target specific elements. Example: `div.my-class { background-color: yellow; }` selects `<div>` elements with the class `my-class`. `.subsection#preview` { border: 1px solid black; }` selects elements with the class `subsection` and the ID `preview`.\n",
    "  - **Descendant combinator Selector**: Selects elements that are descendants of a specified element. Example: `div p { color: red; }` selects all `<p>` elements inside `<div>` elements. `.container .item { padding: 10px; }` selects all elements with the class `item` that are descendants of elements with the class `container`."
